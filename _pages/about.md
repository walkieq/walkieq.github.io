I will join the University of Bristol in January 2026 as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor, US equivalent) in the School of Electrical, Electronic and Mechanical Engineering (EEME). I am current a Research Associate in the Custom Computing Research Group working with [Prof. Wayne Luk](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wl) in the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), focusing on the intersection of machine learning (ML), domain-specific hardware, and design automation.

With over 12 years of experience spanning academia and industry, I previously worked as a Senior Engineer at Marvell Semiconductor, specializing in CPU microarchitecture design and verification, and later an FPGA Specialist at China Financial Futures Exchange, where I developed low-latency FinTech computing systems.

I obtained my PhD from Imperial College London under the supervision of Prof. Wayne Luk. I received my B.S. in Microelectronics and M.S. in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2008 and 2011 respectively.

My research centers on domain-specific hardware architectures and design automation for AI/ML workloads, leading to numerous high-impact publications in top journals such as TECS, TVLSI, TRETS, TPDS, and TCAD, as well as premier conferences including DAC, ICCAD, ASP-DAC, FCCM, FPL, ASAP, and FPT. I have received Best Paper Award Nominations at leading conferences, including FCCM’20, ASAP’19, FPT’19, and FPT’18, and have authored 48 peer-reviewed publications (12 journal articles and 36 conference papers) in AI/ML hardware architecture and automation.

Conventional design of matrix-vector multiplications (MVM) for RNNs is row-wise, however, it will bring system stall due to data dependency. To eliminate the data dependency in RNNs, we proposed column-wise MVM for RNNs in this paper.
